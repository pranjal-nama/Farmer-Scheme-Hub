# Farmer-Scheme-Hub
This project aims to develop a portal that will act as a centralized database for all government schemes related to agriculture and farming. The portal will serve as a comprehensive repository of information on various schemes available to farmers, including description, eligibility criteria, and benefits offered. 
In addition, the portal will provide a platform for government officials to access information on eligible farmers who have not yet availed of these schemes, thereby ensuring that the benefits of government schemes are reaching the intended beneficiaries. The proposed portal will enhance the transparency and efficiency of the government's efforts to support farmers and promote agricultural development.
The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in the growth and development of any country's economy. However, farmers often face several challenges, including lack of access to information and resources, which hinder their progress. To support farmers and promote their well-being, governments around the world have implemented various schemes and programs. However, despite their best efforts, many eligible farmers are unaware of these initiatives or face obstacles in availing of them. 
To bridge this gap and facilitate better communication between farmers and government officials, this portal serve as a one-stop-shop for all government schemes for farmers.
